# 65-o-fun Snake (Clone)

## Introduction

This is a clone of the popular snake game written for my emulated 6502 based retro computer [65-o-fun](https://github.com/y0014984/65-o-fun) running in a browser. This game also uses routines of the [BIOS](https://github.com/y0014984/65-o-fun-bios) written for my 65-o-fun.

## Build

This project is written using Kick Assembler v5.25. Download Kick Assembler [here](https://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler) and follow the provided installation instructions. If you have already downloaded/cloned this repo you can run this command in the project directory to build the *.prg file that you can load and run in the 65-0-fun. Replace `KickAss.jar` with the path where you installed Kick Assembler. 

```bash
java -jar KickAss.jar snake.asm
```
